Python Coding Homework
----------------------
Contained in this exercise are 2 data sets in text delimited format, a point geometry set named 'zip.csv' and a polygon geometry set named 'states.csv'.  Using Python, write a script which analyzes these 2 data sets and creates a new data set named 'stated_points.csv'.  The new set should contain the original fields from 'zip.csv', as well as the 'state' field from the 'states.csv' polygon in which the point lies.

Your code may not use ArcPy, but you may use ANY other Python library or module that you wish.  Your code and the output file it generates should be checked into your Github account.

You will be expected to discuss your code in person with one or more GIS Data Engineers at Tableau.  This is similar to the process we use internally when we develop new utilities for our team to use.

Good luck!
